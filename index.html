                <h3>Meredith Anne Phillips</h3>
                <div class="rating">★★★★★</div>
                <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2018</p>
                <p>This book sheds much-needed light on the epidemic of suicide--the incidence of which has risen sharply even as physical illnesses such as cancer have become less frequent. Through clear, candid prose, Dr. Williams details his treatment plan with one of his most challenging patients, a high school student who came to him after nine months of contemplating suicide, and whom he gingerly convinces to put off her plans. One of the great things about this book is the way the author, a practicing adolescent psychiatrist in suburban Philadelphia, parries with the platitudes of modern psychiatry--the need to hospitalize, protect oneself from malpractice, medicate--while developing an empathetic relationship with the patient that ultimately proves to be more meaningful, and more successful. An excellent read for anyone whose life has touched suicide, as survivor, therapist, friend or relative.</p>

                <h3>Maudie White</h3>
                <div class="rating">★★★★★</div>
                <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2018</p>
                <p>This groundbreaking work captures the difficult journey through suicidality for both patient and doctor. Grace's ability to narrate her pain, followed by the doctor's insight, is riveting. Seeing the transformation in Grace through her writings while in recovery is the very essence of hope. This book shows how there is a path to recovery for anyone suffering and guidance to medical professionals.</p>
